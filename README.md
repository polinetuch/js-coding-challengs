# Javascript Coding Challenges

## :sunglasses: In this repository, I am showcasing my Javascript skills learnt from a Udemy Course. Each of the challenge is solved using just pure Javascript.

### Challenge 1: Calculate two people's body mass index

This challenge is working with Javascript operators. It refers back to to the [Precendence Table](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_Precedence).
The **division /** operator has a precedency of 15, but in this case the operator assignment inside the **bracket ()**, which has a precedency of 20, so the operator begins the assignment (left to right) multiply assignment before division.
Please refer to Challenge 1 folder for solution.
