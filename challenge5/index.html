      Challenge 5: Working with objects, properties, loops, arrays, functions
      and methods
    </h1>
    <h4>
      <p>
        This time, John and his family went to 5 different restaurants. The
        bills were $124, $48, $268, $180 and $42. John likes to tip 20% of the
        bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% when the bill is between $50
        and $200, and 10% if the bill is more than $200.
      </p>

      <ol>
        Implement a tip calculator using objects and loops:
        <li>Create an object with an array for the bill values</li>
        <li>Add a method to calculate the tip</li>
        <li>
          This method should include a loop to iterate over all the paid bills
          and do the tip calculations
        </li>
      </ol>

      <ol>
        As an output, create
        <li>a new array containing all tips</li>
        <li>an array containing final paid amounts (bill + tip)</li>
        <li>
          HINT: Start with two empty arrays [] as properties and then fill them
          up in the loop.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        EXTRA AFTER FINISHING: Mark's family also went on a holiday, going to 4
        different restaurants. The bills were $77, $375, $110, and $45. Mark
        likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $100, 10% when
        the bill is between $100 and $300, and 25% if the bill is more than $300
        (different than John).
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          Implement the same functionality as before, this time using Mark's
          tipping rules
        </li>
        <li>
          Create a function (not a method) to calculate the average of a given
          array of tips
        </li>
        <li>Calculate the average tip for each family</li>
        <li>
          Log to the console which family paid the highest tips on average
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        HINT: Loop over the array, and in each iteration store the current sum
        in a variable (starting from 0). After you have the sum of the array,
        divide it by the number of elements in it (that's how you calculate the
        average)
