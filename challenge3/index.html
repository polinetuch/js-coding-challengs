    <title>Calculate Bills</title>

  <body>
      <p>
          John and his family went on a holiday and went to 3 different
          restaurants. The bills were $124, $48 and $268.
      </p>
      <p>
          To tip the waiter a fair amount, John created simple tip calculator.
          He likes to tip 20% of the bill when the bill is less than $50, 15% 
          when the bill is between $50 and $200, and 10% if the bill is more $200.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the end, John would like to have 2 arrays:
          <ol>
              <li>Containing all three tips (one for each bill)</li>
              <li>Containing all three final paid amounts (bill + tip)</li>
          </ol>
      </p>
